# Electoral system management

## Description

To facilitate user registration within an electoral system, adherence to specific rules is imperative. Consequently, when constructing the database for electoral system management, it's crucial not only to populate each table with data but also to validate the eligibility of users for their respective roles. This project leverages Brazilian legislation as a framework for establishing an electoral system management database.
